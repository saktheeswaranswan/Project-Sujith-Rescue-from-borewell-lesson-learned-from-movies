How to use in AutoCAD

Copy the script into a text editor and save it as polyline.scr.

In AutoCAD, type SCRIPT in the command line.

Load the script file.

A closed polyline will be drawn with the given coordinates.

Got it — you want to replace the first coordinate (0.0019,0.0027) with (56,77) and then convert the entire list into relative coordinates for an AutoCAD PLINE script.

Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1️⃣ Original absolute coordinates
0.0019,0.0027  
5.0138,0.0058  
5.0064,2.0077  
2.0090,2.0077  
1.9952,1.0200  
1.0212,1.0132  
1.0281,3.0092  
3.9981,3.0092  
4.0221,4.9777  
-0.0110,7.0080

2️⃣ Replace the first point

First point becomes:

56,77


So, new absolute coordinate list:

56,77  
5.0138,0.0058  
5.0064,2.0077  
2.0090,2.0077  
1.9952,1.0200  
1.0212,1.0132  
1.0281,3.0092  
3.9981,3.0092  
4.0221,4.9777  
-0.0110,7.0080

3️⃣ Convert to relative coordinates (@ΔX,ΔY)

Relative offset = Current point − Previous point:

Start point: 56,77

Next point: (5.0138−56, 0.0058−77) → @-50.9862,-76.9942

(5.0064−5.0138, 2.0077−0.0058) → @-0.0074,2.0019

(2.0090−5.0064, 2.0077−2.0077) → @-2.9974,0.0000

(1.9952−2.0090, 1.0200−2.0077) → @-0.0138,-0.9877

(1.0212−1.9952, 1.0132−1.0200) → @-0.9740,-0.0068

(1.0281−1.0212, 3.0092−1.0132) → @0.0069,1.9960

(3.9981−1.0281, 3.0092−3.0092) → @2.9700,0.0000

(4.0221−3.9981, 4.9777−3.0092) → @0.0240,1.9685

(-0.0110−4.0221, 7.0080−4.9777) → @-4.0331,2.0303

4️⃣ Final AutoCAD PLINE command
PLINE
56,77
@-50.9862,-76.9942
@-0.0074,2.0019
@-2.9974,0.0000
@-0.0138,-0.9877
@-0.9740,-0.0068
@0.0069,1.9960
@2.9700,0.0000
@0.0240,1.9685
@-4.0331,2.0303
C


Would you like me to generate this as a .scr script file ready for AutoCAD import?





Got it — you want 4–5 different prompt variations you can reuse for this type of AutoCAD relative coordinate conversion task.
Here are clean and precise prompts for future use:

Prompt 1 – Replace and Convert

Replace the first point X1,Y1 with A,B in this PLINE command and then convert all coordinates to relative coordinates (using @ΔX,ΔY) for AutoCAD.
End the command with C.

Example:

Original: PLINE 0.0019,0.0027 5.0138,0.0058 5.0064,2.0077 2.0090,2.0077 ... -0.0110,7.0080 C
Replace: 0.0019,0.0027 → 56,77

Prompt 2 – Pure Relative Script

Convert this absolute PLINE coordinate list to a relative AutoCAD PLINE script.
Start from the first point as-is, then every next point should be in @ΔX,ΔY format, with precision up to 4 decimals.
Finish with C.

Prompt 3 – Ready-to-Import SCR

Take these PLINE coordinates, replace the first point with X,Y, convert the rest to relative coordinates, and generate a ready .scr script for AutoCAD that I can import directly. Include the PLINE command at the start and C at the end.

Prompt 4 – Step-by-Step Calculation

Step 1: Replace the first point with the given new point.
Step 2: Calculate relative offsets between consecutive points.
Step 3: Generate the final AutoCAD PLINE script using @ΔX,ΔY format for each step, ending with C.

Prompt 5 – Multiple Precision Options

Convert these coordinates to relative AutoCAD PLINE format with different rounding levels: 3 decimals, 4 decimals, and 5 decimals.
Start point absolute, rest relative, ending with C.

Would you like me to generate a .scr file right now for the example coordinates you gave?
